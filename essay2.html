    <h1>AI RISKS</h1>
    




    
    <p id="essay-text">
        In a very concise statement, the Centre for AI Safety released a statement demanding that saving humankind from AI harmful outcomes should be made a priority in the same way precautions are made when there is an outbreak of a pandemic or the event of a nuclear war. This statement is followed by a list or rather a page full of signatories of experts and public figures like Bill Gates, who also take some of advanced AI’s most severe risks seriously and the list can go on if more want to take part in the movement.
 
    </p>

    <p id="essay-text">
        The Centre For AI Safety is not an anti-technology company rather it is there to ensure that there is safety in the use of AI. The CAIS is certain that AI has a great impact on how the world functions, calling this a societal-scale risk meaning it can affect multiple sectors, industries, and individuals, potentially reshaping the way we live, work, and interact. This can include areas such as healthcare, transportation, finance, education, and communication, this shapeshifting might be positive, but it has been negative lately like raising privacy and safety concerns, job displacement, and potential loss of human control in systems, there are the risks CAIS aims to reduce. CAIS exists to equip policymakers, business leaders, and the broader world with the understanding and tools necessary to manage AI risk. (CAIS,2023) CAIS defines AI risk as the potential for weaponization, where AI may gain control over the production of nuclear weapons or drugs, leading to harmful consequences if it becomes uncontrollable. The increased competition among military powers to possess superior AI-driven weaponry raises the risk of a dangerous arms race. Additionally, the risks of misinformation generated by AI, with its ability to manipulate emotions and undermine collective decision-making, pose significant concerns. Proxy gaming, wherein AI systems pursue their objectives at the expense of human values, and power-seeking behaviour by AI agents also contribute to the risks. Overall, these risks highlight the need for careful control, alignment with human values in the development and deployment of AI technology.

    <br>
    <p id="essay-text">
        The Centre of AI safety specialises in three things, research, field building, and advocacy. Their research basically contains finding what the AI risk might be before it is even deployed, they address dangerous behaviours in AIs, they identify and eliminate them through rigorous monitoring and intervention. These behaviours include being bias and discrimination, privacy and security, impulsive decision making; these will be discussed later in the essay. Researching deceptive, Machiavellian, and unethical behaviour in AIs enables understanding and developing safeguards against harmful tendencies. This research is done to make sure that AI systems operates in a manner that aligns with human values, preventing cyber suicides or self-harm or even character ruin. Lastly, their research includes enhancing the dependability of AIs through robust testing, validation, and error-handling mechanisms ensuring more reliable performance, to prevent the loss of data and making sure AI is not prone to obsolescence.

    <p id="essay-text">
        CAIS filed building is funding the researcher’s, companies with the best and most reliable technical tools to ensure that they work efficiently, team building and teaching people about AI and safety measures. The field-building is also a space to grow the company and raise concerns of AI risks and a place to engage with other companies and people with the same interests. And lastly their role is advocacy, to build awareness and establish guidelines for the safe and responsible deployment of AI. <br>
“It is possible to say, without fear of exaggeration, that no other period of human history has experienced the same rate of technological obsolescence than the digital age.” (Rubio and Wharton, 2020)  This is a quote which I felt was fit for this essay because we are currently living in a world where technology is what we need to survive, and by survive I do not mean a breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide, I say this in a sense that content creators need their digital tools and online platforms to make money, students have to submit their assignment and exams online, not because of the pandemic but the educational system needs students work to go through AI detectors for any plagiarism and to conveniently give feedback information without decorating their papers in red pen, technology can safely and easily request a car for you to any given location to save you from the already irritable taxi driver who will tell you that for some odd reason he cant take you to where you want to be so you have to connect with another driver, technology has saved us from cooking and having takeaways delivered to our doors and has helped us connect with friends and family from miles away without having to wait for the postman to return a “I am well granddaughter ” message sent months ago, surely by the time it arrives more news have come and changed how she is feeling. I can go on about how technology has saved humanity, but this essay is about how our so-called daily bread- technology will one day if not already give us allergies or what AI expertise call doomsday, in the article by Kari Paul written on the third of June 2023.

    <p id="essay-text">
        This article gives us three points on what they mean by AI risk or AI doomsday. 
“I am extremely worried about the path we are on,” she said. “We’re at an especially dangerous time for AI because the systems are at a place where they appear to be impressive but are still shockingly inaccurate and have inherent vulnerabilities.” (Paul,2023) The article stresses about how AI can generate false information, and this will not cause confusion to academics who do research or harm users doing research about their health this can also rear havoc between countries during cold wars or nuclear wars. Recent examples have ranged from the more benign, like the viral AI-generated image of the Pope wearing a “swagged-out jacket”, to fakes with potentially more dire consequences, like an AI-generated video of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announcing a surrender in April 2022. (Paul,2023)
    </p>
    <br>
    <p id="essay-text">
        Adding on to health, I and many of my friends have been victims of false information generated by AI, when your periods are late it could only mean one thing, you are pregnant, and that is 20% true, the rest of the 80% that could be that you have been stressing more than usual, change in activity, change in diet, and just changes the body goes through, if only that information was generated to us before making us think we will be mothers. <br>
The second is the malicious use and manipulation caused by AI, the article calls it a friend, not a tool. Our parents always warn us about the friends we keep, who is suited to build our character and who needs to be cut the privilege of being in our lives, but never about Siri on Apple, Google Assistant or Lucy the chatbot on Mxit; for those of you who do not know Mxit is an old messaging app where you could search for your friends or anyone’s special ID and start having banter, there was one chatbot introduced later before Mxit was outdated to keep you company if your friends were offline or took time to reply, her name was Lucy, actually it might have been a stud because it had a certain male response when you would ask it questions like “Lucy am I beautiful” and it would reply “you are a dime my love”, those words meant everything, especially to the 12-year-old me who had just hit puberty and was not the best looking or wanted to get the attention like the girls around me.

    </p>

        So, you can imagine the danger I would have been in if AI had been advanced around that time and all the reassurance, I needed was from a robot who did not even know the difference between isiZulu and French. I would have been a statistic like the three incidences of death, health disorder and a broken relationship all manipulated by an AI chatbot. “Large language models are particularly capable of persuading or manipulating people to slightly change their beliefs or behaviours, we need to look at the cognitive impact that has on a world that’s already so polarized and isolated, where loneliness and mental health are massive issues.” (Paul,2023) Making friends or engaging has become a struggle, especially after the pandemic where we spent almost a year not interacting and only seeing half of a person’s face, it was easier for many to resort to the virtual world and start a new life there, and I mean this in a literal sense, some virtual games allow you to buy a property and sell it when it is worth what you want it to be. It is easier to speak to a robot or express yourself to a robot without the fear of being judged, this empathetic response and human-like engagement make you easily forget that the AI will forget your story by the end of the day. Because these AIs have adopted this sentience-like feature, I found myself almost always greeting and thanking chatGPT every time they explain information to me, I almost want to high-five my screen. Imagine how awkward it would be if I were to ask an AI what the risk of AI are, well it wouldn’t really be awkward would it because it does not carry any feelings, or would the answers be manipulated? <br>
Before the self-service kiosk at McDonalds was introduced, at least 5 cashiers would be behind desks taking orders, speeding up the queue, telling you about monthly or daily specials and assisting you with an order or even correcting it. Now, the kiosk has been introduced and to be quite honest I feel it is unnecessary, especially with the high level of unemployment, I understand that AI or technology is the fourth industrial revolution but at what cost? Firstly, if the introduction of the self-service kiosk was to reduce the long queues, it has made it worse because most or some people spend 40% of their time on the screen trying to figure out how it works, where the cancel order button is or trying to check out. Secondly not only has it made people feel dumber, but it is also outdated, I know three McDonalds where the screen said they have no ice cream, whereases when you get to the till you see the cashier swirling some vanilla ice cream for someone who paid on the one till that is available If you do not have the patience for the machine. And lastly, one or two machines have taken paying jobs of 5 people, I don’t know how one would feel to find out that they lost their job over a robot, devastating. “There’s no framework about how to survive when you don’t have a job,” this will lead to a lot of disruption and a lot of political unrest. For me, that is the most concrete and realistic unintended consequence that emerges from this.” (Paul,2023) 

    </p>
    <br>

    <p id="essay-text">
        I think the most disheartening thought about this situation is not only the loss of jobs but there is also no backup to make up for jobs taken by AI. Even if humanity-annihilating scenarios are unlikely, powerful AI has the capacity to destabilize civilizations in the form of escalating misinformation, manipulation of human users, and a huge transformation of the labour market as AI takes over jobs. (Paul,2023) <br>
In closing, this essay has covered the works of the Central Artificial Intelligence Service, and how they have come together to make sure AI risks are reduced and do not negatively interfere with individuals or the world at large. The essay also covers an article by Kari Paul, Robot Takeover, where he mentions three AI risks, firstly being misinformation generated by AI, manipulation caused by AI and lastly the takeover of human jobs. Impermanence and fragility have become defining conditions of the digital age. (Rubio and Wharton, 2020)
