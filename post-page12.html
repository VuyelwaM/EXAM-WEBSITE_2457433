        <p class="post-text">The paper discusses the importance of integrating values into the design of technical systems and software games. While values such as privacy, community, freedom from bias, and trust have been recognized as important, implementing them in design practices remains challenging. The paper acknowledges the absence of explicit guidelines for embedding values in software systems and aims to address this gap.

            The authors present the RAPUNSEL project as a case study in a values-rich context. The project aims to develop a networked game environment to teach programming to middle-school girls. The interdisciplinary team involved in the project, including computer scientists, interaction designers, and social psychologists, navigates the complexity of integrating values throughout the design process.
            
            The paper outlines a methodological framework for considering values during design. The framework draws on existing approaches and analytic frameworks such as Value Sensitive Design, Participatory Design, Reflective Practice, and Critical Technical Practice. It highlights the importance of iteratively addressing questions about values and systematically implementing them in the design.
            
            Throughout the project, various values conflicts arise, requiring careful consideration and resolution. The paper provides specific examples of these conflicts and how they were addressed. The goal is not to replace established design methodologies but to demonstrate how attention to values can inform and enhance existing design processes.
            
            The contributions of the paper are three-fold. Firstly, it presents a case study of an interdisciplinary design process in a values-rich context. Secondly, it provides an overview of frameworks and methods employed in addressing values in design. Thirdly, it offers a set of steps for discovering, analyzing, and integrating values within the system.
            
            By shedding light on the benefits and challenges of a values-oriented approach in design, the paper aims to encourage the adoption of such methodologies in various design contexts, particularly those with social and educational components.
            
            Overall, the paper emphasizes the need for designers to consider values explicitly in their work and offers practical guidance for incorporating values into the design process.
