            Article by Giorgos Verdi 
            Written November 22, 2020
            The article suggests that artificial intelligence has the capacity to positively impact global productivity in several ways. Firstly, AI can automate routine tasks, which are repetitive and time-consuming, freeing up human resources to focus on more complex and creative endeavours. By taking over mundane tasks, AI can increase efficiency and productivity within various industries.
            Secondly, AI has the potential to enhance existing job roles that are not fully automated. For example, AI tools and technologies can assist professionals in making data-driven decisions, analysing large datasets, or optimizing processes. By leveraging AI capabilities, individuals can become more productive in their roles and achieve better outcomes.
            Lastly, the article acknowledges that AI can disrupt entire industries. This means that AI technologies and applications can fundamentally transform traditional business models, operations, and market dynamics. Some industries may experience significant changes, while new industries and opportunities may emerge as a result of AI advancements.
            The statement highlights the significance of artificial intelligence (AI) for the survival and prosperity of countries in the 21st century. However, it also points out a paradox: only a few states have developed National Strategies on AI despite its importance. The United States and China have emerged as dominant players in AI development, largely due to the presence of influential multinational corporations known as GAFAMI (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM) and BATX (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi) in these countries. These corporations collectively hold a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion, indicating their significant influence and financial strength.
            The article highlights the geoeconomic potential of artificial intelligence and the dynamics that may arise between AI superpowers (such as the United States and China) and other states, particularly developing countries.
            The inability of most states to compete with AI superpowers reveals the dependency that many countries may have on the US and China to secure access to AI technology. Without the necessary infrastructure and capabilities to develop AI systems of their own, these states may turn to the superpowers to ensure access to AI, which is seen as crucial for their prosperity and security.
            In exchange for supplying AI technology, the US and China are likely to request political and economic gains from client states. This relationship is expected to emerge primarily in developing countries, where the automation brought about by AI could disrupt low-wage industrial employment. To mitigate the socioeconomic impact, developing countries may sign deals with AI superpowers, allowing them access to technology and economic aid, as they may be unable to tax the multinational corporations (domestic champions) operating within their territory.
            The AI superpowers have two main incentives for seeking these relationships. Firstly, by establishing client states, they expand their political and economic control into new geographical regions, further solidifying their influence. Secondly, these relationships provide access to enormous streams of data. Developing countries, in exchange for access to AI technology, may offer the data of their citizens, providing the AI superpowers with a competitive advantage in the data-driven AI ecosystem.
            The article asks whether it is techno-colonialism or the new dark age, it is technically and practically both. China and USA exerting control or influence over less technologically advanced countries or regions is techno-colonialism and the New dark age is a space in time where technology has a huge impact on society.
